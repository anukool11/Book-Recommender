The above paper titled "Are we really making much progress? A worrying analysis of recent neural recommendation approaches", discusses about how unnecessarily complex neural network based recommendation engines fail to outperform simple collaborative filtering with KNN or MF based recommender systems. A lot of deep network based models are published that are not reproducible, and are further using deep network based comparison baselines. The paper does a wonderful job of filtering the reproducible models and comparing with much simpler models which are clearly seen to be outperforming.
